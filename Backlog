A bunch of informal descriptions of user stories to go by:
[use GitPython or fall back to native git cmds if it's not available]
[NEVER let old branches be garbage collected!]
[use smart tab completion for task titles somehow]

kaban help
What's up, this is kaban 0.1.0, your favorite command line task manager,
reporting for duty. Use the following commands to handle your tasks and todos:

kaban init
Don't worry, you already have a kaban repo at [...]

kaban init --local
New kaban repo initialized.
Just a heads up: this repo will *not* be synced to GitHub unless you provide
your GitHub credentials and say `kaban autopush`.

kaban add "Reload ion cannons"
New task added at top level. If you'd prefer to move it to a bag just say
`kaban mv mybag`.
Autopush failed though. It looks like you haven't provided your GitHub
credentials yet.

You have no username or personal access token specified in [...] yet.
Just say `kaban user yourgithubusername` and `kaban token youraccesstoken`
when you're ready.
